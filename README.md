 # First Milestone
  
The first milestone was done in 2023 with the construction of the car and using UltraSonic waves and IR Obstocale Avoidance module. This allowed the Car to indepedently change course and avoid collosions.

# Second Milestone
The 2nd Milestone done in October/November 2024 I was able to perform was converting the Obstocal avoidance car into a IR Remote control while minamizing replacment parts.
Using the Infrared Wavelength and the same operating princple of a TV remote. Using pulses of Infared light to the IR reciver translate into binary for the CPU Motherboard using this it takes this data and applies it to the code I provided to the device to via an H bridge send electircal singinals that turn the 2 dual gear electric tt motors.
