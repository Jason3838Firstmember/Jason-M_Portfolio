# Final Milestone
  The final milestone is to get able to understand its surroundings and move to avoid collsions. and move on its own.https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/3in1-kit/en/latest/car_project/car_auto.html



# Second Milestone

 the second was wiring and coding the bot to move using an adrunio uno to get it to move in a pattern of forward turn clockwise and then counterclockwise. Using https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/3in1-kit/en/latest/car_project/car_auto.html https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_3hY4ITGJA

# First Milestone
  The first Milestone was to get the bot/car assembled. 
  The only real difficulty was wiring
  This was done using https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/3in1-kit/en/latest/car_project/car_assemble.html
